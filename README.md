Limb Equation is a helper program to test how different limb thickness equations will be converted into voxel based limbs

In the thickness equation you can use the 2 variables:
 - **a** to change thickness based on the angle around the limb
 - **i** to change thickness based on the length down the limb

The right side canvas sets up what angles the sections stop at. All sections start at some multiple of 90 degrees.
